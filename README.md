## Introduction

Skin diseases can have serious consequences if left untreated, leading to discomfort, disfigurement, and even mortality in severe cases. The Preliminary Detection of Dermatological Diseases project aims to address this problem by providing a telemedicine platform for individuals to upload images of their skin lesions and receive preliminary diagnoses from trained machine learning models.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing results
- Integration with machine learning models, based on DenseNet-121, for automated diagnosis
- Secure storage and handling of sensitive medical data
- Real-time notifications for urgent cases requiring immediate attention
- Image data augmentation for improved model robustness

## Installation

To install and set up the Preliminary Detection of Dermatological Diseases platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/dermatological-disease-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd dermatological-disease-detection
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the database and environment variables as needed.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start the web application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000` and follow the instructions to upload images and view diagnosis results.

## Model Architecture

The Preliminary Detection of Dermatological Diseases platform utilizes deep learning models based on DenseNet-121 architecture. These models are trained on a dataset of annotated skin lesion images and are capable of classifying images into different disease categories, providing users with preliminary diagnoses based on visual analysis.

## Dataset

The model training dataset consists of thousands of annotated images of various skin conditions, sourced from medical databases and research institutions. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease category for supervised learning.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, user feedback and expert evaluation are used to assess the platform's effectiveness in providing accurate and timely diagnoses.
